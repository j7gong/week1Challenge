# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor #

The goal is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible, which is to improve code without changing what it does.

## User Story ##
As a marketing agency, 

I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards,

so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria ##

* Given a webpage meets accessibility standards,

    * when I view the source code, 
    
        then I find semantic HTML elements.

    * when I view the structure of the HTML elements, 
        
        then I find that the elements follow a logical structure 
        
        independent of styling and positioning. 
    
    * when I view the image elements, 

        then I find accessible alt attributes.

    * when I view the heading attributes,

        then they fall in sequential order.

    * when I view the title element, 

        then I find a concise, descriptive title.
